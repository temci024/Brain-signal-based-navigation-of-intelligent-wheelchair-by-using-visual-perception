## Problem Statement:
Individuals with spinal cord injuries or paralysis, despite having a healthy brain and vision, face a significant
challenge in independently navigating their wheelchairs in known environments. The inability to utilize their
hands and legs for wheelchair control hinders their mobility and independence, necessitating constant reliance
on others for movement. This dependence on external assistance limits their ability to explore and navigate
their surroundings freely. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop innovative solutions that empower
these individuals to regain control over their wheelchair navigation.
